1. **Play:** We are here to have fun and play games. Whether we play to earn or to just have fun, that’s where all of this starts.
2. **Earn:** In a metaverse with property rights, our efforts in a game have value. We have many trainers who have digital assets, and we have scholars who borrow assets to earn. We connect those who have assets and relatively little time with those who have time and relatively little assets to bring wealth to our community.
3. **Build:** We want to build good things, to help each other in the guild and to help outside of games in real life. We will be building our guild to become more powerful so that we can empower others, within and outside our guild, in the metaverse and in real life.
4. **Share:** We believe that the endgame for play-to-earn is to empower the less fortunate all over the globe. Our goal is to share our profits with the world and store our treasures in heaven.

### What’s in the name?

None of us are “whales”, or people who hold large amounts of crypto assets. So, we resolved to become “whales of heaven” instead of “whales on earth” by doing good on earth and storing our treasures in heaven.
