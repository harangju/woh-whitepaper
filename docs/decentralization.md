**Whales of Heaven** (WoH) is a guild of gamers in the land of web3. Some members own assets, some don’t. Instead of pooling assets into the control of one or a few people (which is not yet possible without Ronin multi-sig), everyone has their own assets, in addition to guild-owned assets. Then, we have [guild services]() that facilitate cooperation across members, whether or not they own assets.

Put another way, most other guilds have a one-to-many structure, one owner to many scholars. We have a many-to-many structure, many owners lend to many scholars. We hope to onboard the Korean community to our guild, in addition to communities elsewhere.

### Decentralized Holdings

Most of our assets are not pool; they are held by different individuals in our guild. Each manager has their own scholars.

Though this is a constraint due to lack of Ronin multi-sig, this design is actually safe, scalable, and frictionless. Any compromised Ronin wallet has no effect on any other wallet. Anyone with axie assets can join without having to give up exclusive ownership of their assets; they don’t even have to move any of their assets.

In addition, we can set up [Scholarships as a Service]() without having to pool the assets of a client. In fact, we can just send the seed phrase to a client so that they have 100% full control of their assets.

### Decentralized Execution

The difficult part of decentralized holdings is coordinating work. Coordination is important to provide goods & services, such as automation and player coaching, that vastly improve game enjoyment, profits, and time savings.

We address this issue by creating a centralized marketplace where anyone in the guild can provide or receive services. Through [guild services](), we can pool resources to reward anyone for contributing to the guild so that anyone can benefit from the skills of others.

### Centralized Guild Assets

In addition to individually owned assets, we have centralized guild assets that we are growing with profits from our [guild services](]). We are growing these assets also through yield from DeFi farming and scholarships.
