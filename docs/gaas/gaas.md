## Our Guild

As a guild, we provide services for *trainers—*gamers who want to join our guild to play, earn, build, and share.

Starting and maintaining a scholarship is challenging. Which axies should you buy? How do I get scholars? How do I coach all of my scholars to maximize your earnings and empower your scholars? Not to mention the many hours you spend paying out your scholars.

We fast-forward your onboarding by

1. figuring out the axies that you should buy for your personal goals,
2. onboarding and coaching your scholars to earn the most you can from your axies, and
3. automating payments and other tedious tasks.

Our focus is now on [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), the most popular NFT game by far, but we will expand in the future to other games.

## Our Services

We offer four broad services: meta, scholar onboarding, coaching, and automation tech.

### Meta

No, this is not Meta, post Facebook. Meta refers to the meta game, or the game of figuring out which characters are good to play.

In Axie Infinity, as in other games, the meta game is often as important, if not more, than a player’s in-game skills.

At WoH, we analyze the best teams for one’s desired goals, including budget, mid-tier, and ranked teams. Moreover, we can package many teams that are perfect for breeding so that you not only get your desired teams but can also scale easily in any market conditions.

### Scholar Onboarding

> Where do I get scholars?

is a question that everyone faces when they start a scholarship. The best scholars are diligent, capable, willing to learn, and honest. Otherwise, you risk getting your axies banned by multiaccounters or ruining your community morale.

We make it easy for anyone to onboard scholars. We gather referrals from the best scholars in our guild and build scholarships from them. With the guild services, you can scale easily.

### Coaching

We offer coaching services by matching the better players with the worse players. Both are rewarded -- these are in-guild gamified missions through which you can earn transferrable rewards with real value.

### Automation Tech

It takes many boring hours to pay out tens to hundreds scholars. It is also not scalable to pay hundreds of coaches or community members for their contributions.

At WoH, we build the tech to automate all of these complex, time-consuming tasks.

## Pricing

Just pay 10% of your scholarship profits to the guild. No upfront costs.

We accelerate your growth, and we grow with you.
